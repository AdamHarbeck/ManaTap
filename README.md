# ManaTap

This project is going to use the MTG API to load card data.

## Week 1
> Create the wireframes for the site.

## Week 2
> Tried creating the core functionality. Updating the state and rerendering were issues that I have face. Setting the state to the updated state works fine but I am not able to get the component to rerender to truly update the state.
