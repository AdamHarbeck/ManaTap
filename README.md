# ManaTap

This was built as a school project to show my ability to use React, Fetch, and Async/Await. It uses the MagicTheGathering.io API

## Introduction
This is a web application that allows the user to search, create virtual decks, and discuss Magic The Gathering cards. The search function lets the user choose the colors of the cards they wish to serach for and conducts a serach based on the user input. A more in depth description of the card is available when the card is clicked on. The virtual decks function allows the user to create a deck and add or remove cards from it. The forum is where users can discuss cards, sets, tournaments, and more.
